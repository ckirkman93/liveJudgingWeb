Cookies & RootScope variables list:

$cookies.getObject('current_user')
$cookies.getObject('selected_event')

$rootScope.teams -- set when /teams loads
$rootScope.categories -- set when /teams, /judges, or /rubrics loads

$cookies.getObject('selectedTeam') -- set when a team modal is opened
$cookies.getObject('selectedCategory') -- set when a category is clicked
$cookies.getObject('uncategorized') -- the uncategorized category object

$cookies.get('teamView')
    Originally 'currentView' -- I changed this since we have rubrics and judges tabs,
    but now that I'm thinking about it, maybe it's good to leave it as one view?
